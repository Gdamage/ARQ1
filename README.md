# ARQ1 - Assembly Programming for Ramses and César Processors

This repository contains programs that I developed during my studies in the course of Computer Engineering at UFRGS, specifically in the discipline of Computer Architecture 1 (INF01108) taught by Professor Renato Perez Ribas.

The programs were written in assembly language for the Ramses and César processors, which are didactic processors used in the discipline. They were designed to illustrate concepts and techniques related to computer organization, such as memory addressing modes, arithmetic and logic operations, and control flow.

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing programs related to a specific topic covered in the discipline. The code is well-commented and documented, making it easy to understand and modify.

By sharing this repository, I hope to contribute to the learning and development of other students interested in computer architecture and assembly programming.

Feel free to clone, study, modify, and use the programs in this repository, under the terms of the MIT License.
