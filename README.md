# INF01108 - ARQ1 - Assembly Programs for Ramses, César, and Intel 8086

This repository contains programs developed in Assembly Language for the Ramses and César educational processors, as well as the Intel 8086 architecture. These programs were developed as part of the course "INF01108 - Computer Architecture 1" at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), taught by Professor Renato Perez Ribas.

The Ramses and César processors were used in practical laboratory activities to learn about the fundamental concepts of computer architecture, while the Intel 8086 programs were developed as a final project for the course. The programs cover a variety of topics, including arithmetic and logical operations, control structures, and memory management.

All programs are organized in their respective directories, along with a README file that provides a brief description of each program and instructions on how to assemble and run them. The programs were developed using the NASM assembler, and some of them require additional tools such as the DOSBox emulator.

This repository serves as a collection of my work throughout the course and as a resource for anyone interested in learning Assembly Language programming. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
